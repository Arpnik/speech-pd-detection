# 🎙️ Voice → 🧠 Parkinson's Detection

## 🚀 What We Did
Trained deep neural network to detect Parkinson's disease from voice alone, achieving **99.4% accuracy**!

## 💡 Why It Matters
Speech changes often appear **before** other Parkinson's symptoms. Early detection = better outcomes.

## 🔬 Models We Tested
| Model | Accuracy | Magic ✨ |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 🥇 WavLM | 99.4% | Only 2 epochs! |
| 🥈 Wav2Vec2 | 99.2% | Self-supervised power |
| 🥉 Xvector+FBanks | 98% | Lightweight champion |
| ⭐ Xvector+MFCCs | 94-97% | Solid performer |
| 🤔 ECAPA-TDNN | 85-90% | Needed more data |

## 📱 Imagine This
Your smartphone analyzing speech patterns during regular calls, providing early warning for millions. No labs. No waiting.

## 🔍 Curious?
Dive into our Jupyter notebook to see how we did it!

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Arpnik/speech-pd-detection

# Navigate to the project directory
cd parkinsons-voice-detection

# Open the notebook
jupyter notebook Parkinsons_Voice_Detection.ipynb
```

## 🔮 Future Implications
This work represents a step toward accessible, early Parkinson's detection that could be deployed via smartphones or other common devices, potentially revolutionizing how we screen for this condition.
